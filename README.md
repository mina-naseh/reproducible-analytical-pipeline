# Building Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

This repository is a sample part of [this project](https://github.com/mina-naseh/lidar-point-transformer).

This repository implements a pipeline for tree detection and classification using LiDAR data, using Local Maxima Filtering (LMF).

## Dataset

The full dataset is freely available on Kaggle: [Tree Detection Lidar RGB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sentinel3734/tree-detection-lidar-rgb/data). The data includes LiDAR scans and field survey information required for training and evaluation.
For educational reasons of having a simple but reproducible pipeline, we used part of the data for this repository and have pushed it here. The whole data has a big size and not reasinble to push. 
Ideally, the raw data should ne handled from user like [here](https://github.com/mina-naseh/lidar-point-transformer), or using Kaggle API.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lidar-point-transformer.git
cd lidar-point-transformer
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Set up your Python environment and install required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Entire Pipeline

Run the `main.py` script to execute all steps of the pipeline sequentially, including preprocessing, Local Maxima Filtering (LMF), and evaluation:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

1. Preprocess ALS data (`main_pre.py`) and create `als_preprocessed/`. It also generates visualizations of preprocessed data, saved in `results_pre/`.
2. Perform Local Maxima Filtering (`main_lmf.py`) and save results in `results_lmf/`.

### 5. Results

- **Preprocessing Outputs**: Available in the `results_pre/` directory, including visualizations of the preprocessed data and statistical summaries.
- **LMF Results**: Available in the `results_lmf/` directory, including detected trees and visualizations.
